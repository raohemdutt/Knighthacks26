# lab/ — the R9700 side (AUP Learning Cloud)

Two pods, one R9700 (gfx1201, 32 GB) each, on https://dub.aupcloud.io. Account A is the **teacher**
(serves Qwen3.8-27B), account B is the **trainer** (LoRA, eval, packaging). Logins and hub API tokens
are on the Notion Credentials page and in your local `.env`; never put them in this repo.

## Which hub is live today (2026-10-10)

| Hub | Accounts | State |
|---|---|---|
| **SJC**, https://sjc.aupcloud.io | **C** and **D** | The one to use. JupyterHub 5.4.4, resource key `gpu` (image `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-base:latest`), accelerators `r9700`, `9070xt`, `strix-halo`, `strix`, `phx`. |
| **DUB**, https://dub.aupcloud.io | **A** and **B** | Kept for when it answers again; it has answered 502 all day. |

The sections below were written against DUB and its accounts A and B. Nothing has been launched on SJC yet, so read
their numbers (credits, timings, the culler) as DUB's until a pod there has been measured.

**Nothing is metered on SJC.** `GET /hub/api/quota/me` answers `balance: 0, unlimited: true, enabled: false` and
`GET /hub/api/quota/rates` answers `enabled: false`: the hub keeps no credit accounts. The controller reads that as
"no limit", not as an empty balance: `quota` and `launch` say `quota disabled on this hub`, a launch is never
refused for credits, and `status` shows no credit figures. On DUB (quota enabled) a balance that cannot cover the
runtime still refuses the launch.

**Accounts and addresses.** An account is any single letter whose `AUP_HUB_USER_<letter>` and
`AUP_HUB_TOKEN_<letter>` keys exist in the environment or the workspace `.env` (the same search as `python -m lab ready`).
The hub it lives on is its `AUP_HUB_URL_<letter>` when that key is set, else `LAB_HUB_URL`, else DUB, so C and D
(`AUP_HUB_URL_C`, `AUP_HUB_URL_D` = `https://sjc.aupcloud.io`) work without renaming a key. `--account both` still means
A and B, which is also the default of `status`, `quota` and `keep-alive`: ask for the SJC pair by letter. The ledger
calls the machines `pod-c` and `pod-d`.

```
python -m lab.controller status --account C                 # read-only: is a pod up, its scheduled end, which hub
python -m lab.controller quota --account C                  # read-only: "quota disabled on this hub"
python -m lab.controller launch --account C --minutes 240 --dry-run
python -m lab.controller launch --account C --minutes 240 [--no-wait]
python -m lab.controller wait --account C
python -m lab.controller keep-alive --account C --minutes 90
python -m lab.controller run-script --account C lab/pod_a_teacher.sh proxy
python -m lab.controller stop --account C
```

The same with `--account D`. `status` answers with `hub` (the address) when the accounts it was asked about share a
hub, and with `hubs` (one address per account) when they do not. Launching and stopping stay the owner's call.

**Reaching a pod from outside.** Once `jupyter-server-proxy` runs on the pod (the `proxy` step of the pod scripts, then
one relaunch; not yet tried on SJC), anything listening on a pod port is at

```
https://<hub>/user/<account>/proxy/<port>/
Authorization: token <hub token>
```

where `<hub>` is `sjc.aupcloud.io` for C and D or `dub.aupcloud.io` for A and B, `<account>` is the user name the hub
knows the account by (not the letter), and `<port>` is the port the server listens on.

## Secret scan: `tests/test_no_secrets.py`

`python -m pytest -q tests/test_no_secrets.py` fails on any credential-shaped text in three places: the repo tree
(what git tracks, plus untracked files it does not ignore), everything under `lab/state/` (the ledger, notes and review
files, ignored by git or not, and `$LAB_STATE_DIR` when it points elsewhere), and the Notion post texts kept in
`fixtures/secrets/notion_posts.txt`. It runs with the rest of `pytest -q` in about a second and prints only
`path:line: label`. A value is never printed.

| Label | What it matches | Left alone on purpose |
|---|---|---|
| hub token | the word `token` or `bearer` (any case, an account letter such as `_C` allowed after it), then `:`, `=` or a space, then 32 hex characters: `Authorization: token ...`, `?token=...`, `"token": "..."`, `AUP_HUB_TOKEN_C=...` | a bare 32-hex string (event ids, Notion page ids and digests have that shape), `token_id`, `tokens`, 40 and 64 hex hashes, `$AUP_HUB_TOKEN_A` |
| hugging face token | `hf_` and 30 or more letters and digits | `hf_hub_download` and other names |
| notion token | `ntn_` (current) or `secret_` (legacy) and 40 or more letters and digits | the prefixes in prose, `secret_key_base` |
| tailscale key | `tskey-`, an optional kind (`auth-`, `api-`) and 20 or more key characters | `tskey-auth-<key>` and `tskey-auth-...` |
| github token | `ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_` or `ghr_` and 36 or more characters, or `github_pat_` and 50 or more | the prefixes in prose |
| private key | a `BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY` header followed by a base64 body, also with JSON `\n` escapes between them | the header alone, a body written as `...` |
| account password | an upper-case `.env` line whose key has `PASS`, `PASSWORD`, `PASSWD` or `PWD` as a whole word, `=`, then 8 or more characters; or a quoted value after a `password`, `passwd` or `pwd` key (JSON, YAML, Python) | `<password>`, `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `changeme`, masked values, code that reads a password, a value that is itself a key name |

A match is dropped when it cannot be a credential: filler such as `xxxx...`, one unit repeated (`0123456789abcdef`
twice), a run of ten of one character, or fewer than 9 distinct characters in a long value (a random 32-hex token
has fewer 3 times in a million). A fake token in a test therefore has to look like filler, or be built at run time.

**Values from the `.env` files.** When a `.env` exists (the clone's, or one of the two folders above it, found the way
`python -m lab ready` finds them, or `$LAB_ENV_FILES`), the test reads it in memory and looks for the value of every key
listed in `config/.env.example` and of every credential-named key (`TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASS`, `PASSWORD`, `PASSWD`, `PWD`,
`API_KEY`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `ACCESS_KEY`, `AUTH_KEY`) in all three places, as written, JSON-escaped and percent-encoded.
Values under 8 characters and keys ending `_DIR` or `_PATH` are skipped. Without a `.env` (CI has none) there is
nothing to look for. A hit reads `env value of <KEY>`.

**When it fails**, take the value out of the file. If it was real, tell Ilan: the credential has to be replaced, not just
deleted (a hub token is minted again, a Notion or Hugging Face token is revoked).

**The proof** is in `fixtures/secrets/`. `cases.json` holds the true and false positives; secret bodies are written
as `{hex32}`, `{hf}`, `{ntn}`, `{tskey}`, `{github}`, `{pem}`, `{password}` and expand to generated values when the test
runs, so the repo never holds one. `notion_posts.txt` holds post texts modeled on real ones (page links, event ids,
hashes, key names) that have to stay clean. To teach the scan a new shape, add it to `SHAPES` with at least one true case
and one near miss (`"near"`); a test fails when a shape has neither. To stop a false alarm, add the text that raised it to
`cases.json` as a case with `"expect": []`, then change the shape.

Limits: binary files and `.gz` archives are not read, a file is read up to 64 MB, and a hub token that is not 32 hex or
a password inside prose is found only through its `.env` value.

## What the pods are

- ROCm 7.13.0, `torch 2.9.1+rocm7.13.0`, `triton 3.5.1+rocm7.13.0`, `hipcc` on PATH, `python3` only.
- No root, no Docker, no SSH. JupyterLab terminal and the Jupyter REST API only. `pip install --user` works
  (binaries land in `~/.local/bin`; the scripts add it to PATH).
- `/home/jovyan` is a persistent NFS volume (models, venv packages, builds survive a relaunch).
  `/opt/workspace` (the Jupyter root) is ephemeral.
- Billing is per elapsed minute (4 credits/min on the R9700, ~60,000 per account). The server enforces no
  runtime cap; AMD staff are fine with long sessions. Stopping is immediate. A 60-minute idle culler
  stops a server that gets no requests, so keep the model server busy or ping it.
- **Tailscale is blocked** on the pods (every tailscale.com host is connection-reset). GitHub, Hugging Face
  and PyPI are reachable.

## Launching a pod

Web form: resource "Basic GPU Environment" (key `gpu`), accelerator `r9700`, runtime up to 240 (the API has
no cap). API, with the account's hub token:

```
POST https://dub.aupcloud.io/hub/api/users/<account>/server
Authorization: token <hub token>
{"runtime_minutes": 600, "resource_type": "gpu", "gpu_selection": "r9700"}
```

Poll `GET /hub/api/users/<account>` until `servers[""].ready`. Stop with `DELETE .../server`.
The private team repo cannot be cloned at launch (no GitHub app on the hub); upload `lab/` after launch
(JupyterLab upload, or `PUT /user/<account>/api/contents/<path>`).

## Controlling the pods: `lab/controller.py`

One command line for the calls above, from the repo root. The keys are `AUP_HUB_USER_<letter>` and `AUP_HUB_TOKEN_<letter>`
in the workspace `.env` (found the way `python -m lab ready` finds them); nothing prints a key or an account name.
Every call answers with one JSON line and exit code 0, 1 or 2, like `python -m lab`.

```
python -m lab.controller status                       # both accounts: running, scheduled end, spend so far, balance
python -m lab.controller quota --transactions         # balances, rates, recent sessions
python -m lab.controller launch --account B --minutes 600 [--dry-run] [--no-wait]
python -m lab.controller wait --account B
python -m lab.controller keep-alive --minutes 90      # a ping every 10 minutes so the idle culler never fires
python -m lab.controller run-script --account B lab/pod_b_trainer.sh smoke
python -m lab.controller stop --account B
```

- Launching and stopping a pod is the owner's call, and pod B goes through the GPU queue: a sitting is denied
  `launch` and `stop` (`lab/machine/allowed.py`). Try `launch --dry-run` first: it checks the balance and sends nothing.
- Safe to repeat: launch of a ready pod and stop of a stopped one say so and send nothing; a launch the hub answered
  with a gateway error is never sent twice.
- `--minutes` has no ceiling (the hub has none). The session is charged when it ends, 4 credits a minute, so
  `status` works the spend out from the start time and a launch the balance cannot cover is refused up front.
- `status` reads only the hub API, which does not count as activity. `keep-alive` pings the pod and so does cost
  240 credits an hour: always give it `--minutes`.
- `run-script` takes its own options before the script's name; everything after the name goes to the script. It
  uploads the script to the pod, runs it in a terminal and waits for the exit code it appends to the output.
- While `lab/state/STOP` exists `launch`, `stop`, `keep-alive` and `run-script` are refused.
- Ledger rows: `controller <command>` for each call, and `pod launch`, `pod stop`, `pod status`, `pod keep-alive`
  (`alive`, `failed_ping`, `lost`) with `node` pod-a or pod-b, which are the rows `python -m lab alerts` reads.
- Tests use `lab/hub_fake.py`, a fake hub on a fake clock built from the recorded answers, so nothing launches or sleeps.

## Box ↔ lab: the hub proxy

Once `pip install --user jupyter-server-proxy` has run on an account and the pod has been relaunched once,
anything listening on a pod port is reachable from outside:

```
https://dub.aupcloud.io/user/<account>/proxy/<port>/...
Authorization: token <hub token>
```

That is how the Jetson calls the teacher (`/proxy/8000/v1/chat/completions`) and how it will pull packaged
models. The `/proxy/absolute/<port>/` form does not work here.

## Teacher (pod A)

```
bash lab/pod_a_teacher.sh proxy      # once per account, then relaunch the pod
bash lab/pod_a_teacher.sh build      # vLLM from source at commit b1388b1 + lab/vllm-gfx1201.diff, ~1 h
bash lab/pod_a_teacher.sh download   # amd/Qwen3.8-27B-Quark-AWQ-INT4-W4A16 (18 GB) into ~/models
bash lab/pod_a_teacher.sh serve      # OpenAI-compatible server on 127.0.0.1:8000, model name "teacher"
```

`lab/vllm-gfx1201.diff` is the set of changes vLLM (commit b1388b1, April 2026) needs on this pod: `num_stages=1`
in the Triton unified attention kernel (64 KB LDS on RDNA4), two platform-detection fixes, the torch pins removed
so the pod's own torch is used (`use_existing_torch.py`), and the GPTQ `compat.cuh` half/half2 `atomicAdd`
fallbacks guarded out because ROCm 7.13 ships those overloads itself. Build gotchas the script handles: no root,
so `cmake`, `ninja` and `pkgconf` come from `pip --user`; the image has no libdrm, so a stub `libdrm.pc` and an
empty `libdrm.so` under `~/.local` satisfy torch's `LoadHIP.cmake`; `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION` avoids a
`git describe` timeout on the NFS home.

Measured on 2026-10-10 with `RedHatAI/Qwen3.8-27B-INT4` (bf16 activations, 16k context, one image per prompt):

| Prompt | TTFT | decode |
|---|---|---|
| text, thinking off, 76 tokens | 0.55 s | 7.8 tok/s |
| text, thinking on, 160 tokens | 0.28 s | 7.7 tok/s |
| 1280x720 JPEG caption, 28 tokens | 1.09 s | 6.6 tok/s |

Engine init takes about 270 s (CUDA-graph capture included), the model holds 84 % of VRAM with ~10x concurrency
at 16k tokens, and the card draws ~200 W average, 300 W peak, while generating. The W4A16 layers run on
`ConchLinearKernel` (the Triton fallback; Marlin/Machete do not exist on ROCm), which is why decode is far
below the 20 to 30 tok/s the design doc estimated. That kernel is the first target for the gfx1201 kernel work.
Pass `"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}` for captions, otherwise the model spends its budget
reasoning.

Checkpoints: `amd/Qwen3.8-27B-Quark-AWQ-INT4-W4A16` and `-MXFP4` are AMD's own Quark exports (Aug 2026) and
would be the better AMD-track story, but this vLLM commit's Quark weight mapper (`quark.py:apply_vllm_mapper`)
rejects their config. Making them load means either moving to a vLLM commit from late August 2026 or later
(which pins torch 2.10+, so torch would come from `repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux` rather than the image) or
backporting that one Python file's mapper, which needs no C++ rebuild. `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` (28.8 GB) is the
last resort and leaves little KV room.

Call it from anywhere:

```
curl https://dub.aupcloud.io/user/<account>/proxy/8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: token $AUP_HUB_TOKEN_A" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"teacher","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Describe this table in one sentence."}]}'
```

Images go inline as `{"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}}` content parts.

## Trainer (pod B)

```
bash lab/pod_b_trainer.sh proxy      # once, then relaunch
bash lab/pod_b_trainer.sh deps       # peft, trl, transformers, accelerate, datasets, gguf (torch stays the pod's)
bash lab/pod_b_trainer.sh llama      # llama-quantize / llama-cli / llama-server built for gfx1201
bash lab/pod_b_trainer.sh download   # Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B (the student the Jetson runs)
bash lab/pod_b_trainer.sh smoke      # lab/smoke_lora.py: tiny LoRA SFT, prints loss and samples/s
```

`smoke_lora.py` is the template for the real trainer (L3): bf16, PEFT LoRA on all linear layers, TRL
`SFTTrainer`, forkserver DataLoader workers, no `torch.compile`.

## Datasets: the box's export and the no-camera fixture

An approved export from the box is a folder named for its dataset id, with `manifest.json`, `examples.jsonl` and
`images/` (the shapes are in `contracts/learning.py`). `lab/dataset.py` reads and checks one, and writes the
teacher's labels back into it. Only `pydantic` and the repo's `contracts/` are needed, so it runs on a pod.

```
python lab/dataset.py <dataset folder>               # checks it against the contract, prints one JSON line
python lab/dataset.py <dataset folder> --text-only   # the same for a dataset with no pictures
```

```python
from lab.dataset import load, write_target

data = load(folder)                       # DatasetError names every problem it found
for example in data.pending():            # the examples that have no target yet
    write_target(folder, example.id, label_for(example, data.image_path(example)))
```

`write_target` replaces `examples.jsonl` whole under a lock, so a labeling run can be killed and started again
and two labelers lose nothing: `pending()` is exactly the work left. Same text again is a no-op; different text
needs `overwrite=True`.

`lab/fixture_dataset.py` builds the tool-calling task's dataset without any camera from
`fixtures/golden/questions.yaml` and `memory.yaml`, in the same layout, into
`fixtures/learning/tool-calling-fixture/`:

```
python lab/fixture_dataset.py                  # rebuilds it (refuses if some examples already have targets)
python lab/fixture_dataset.py --no-variants    # only the golden questions
```

Each example is a question (`context`) with an empty `target`. A label is the JSON text
`{"tool_calls": [{"name": ..., "arguments": {...}}], "answer": "..."}`, and `manifest.json` carries its schema.
`expected.jsonl` holds what a correct label looks like, taken from the agent's own pre-fetch code; the teacher
never sees it. Read `lab/fixture_dataset.py`'s docstring for how groups and `origin` support a split that keeps
the golden questions out of training. Both scripts write a ledger row and stop while `lab/state/STOP` exists.
